# Alt Controller:
Be aware: anyone can use the chat commands to control your alts.

There are currently 8 commands implemented in the alt controller bot.

All the commands only target the roblox instances that you aren't currently focused into.

1 - !reset - Makes all your alts reset character.

2 - !arena (buggy) - Makes your alts that are in the lobby walk into the arena portal (This command will take a long time for it to finish and you gotta use it twice for the first time for it to work, I don't know why).

3 - !dance - Makes your alts bust 'em moves.

4 - !jump - Makes all your alts jump, I don't know why I added this.

5 - !ability - Makes your alts pull out their glove and use its ability.

6 - !scatter - Makes your alts walk in a random direction. (This command requires the Click To Move movement mode to be enabled).

7 - !slap - Makes your alts pull out their glove and click.

8 - !tournament (buggy) - Makes your alts join the tournament, if there is currently a tournament notification.
